# EDA Project: Web Scraping and Analysis.

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive exploration of the streaming entertainment landscape, driven by data analysis techniques. Through the utilization of Python's Beautiful Soup library, data is systematically extracted from JustWatch.com, a reputable streaming service aggregator. This extracted data, encompassing IMDb ratings, runtimes, genres, year of release and streaming service details, undergoes examination and visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn within a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). The project aims to provide valuable insights into viewer preferences, discerning trends such as mean IMDb ratings, average runtimes for movies and shows, top genres, leading streaming services, and the highest-rated movies on Netflix. By delving into this analysis, viewers and content providers alike can gain a deeper understanding of the streaming landscape and make informed decisions accordingly.
